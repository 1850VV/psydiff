### PyDiff: a structural comparison tool for Python

PyDiff is the forerunner of ydiff, which I implemented around 2010 while I rested at home after a surgery.

Later I developed ydiff based on the same algorithm of PyDiff, while supporting multiple languages. Unfortunately I never got a chance to write a Python parser for ydiff. Thus I put the original code for PyDiff here, just in hope it can be useful to someone.



### Usage

Just run pydiff.py from the command line:

    ./pydiff.py demos/list1.py demos/list2.py



### Demo

A demo of PyDiff's output (while it worked) can be found here:
