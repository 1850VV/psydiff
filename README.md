### PyDiff: a structural comparison tool for Python

PyDiff is the forerunner of ydiff, which I implemented around 2009 while I rested at home after a surgery.

Later I developed ydiff, which was designed as a total replacement for PyDiff, while supporting multiple languages. Unfortunately I never got a chance to write a Python parser for ydiff. Thus I put the original code for PyDiff here, just in hope it can be useful to someone.

Currently the JavaScript navigation in PyDiff is broken because of changes made from ydiff. It should be quite easy to fix. So stay tuned.
